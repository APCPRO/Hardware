# emonTx V2


A a low power wireless energy monitoring node. Powered by an Atmega328 with Arduino bootloader.

It's designed to sense data from up to three CT current sensors, optically from a pulse-output utility meter and monitor temperatures from multiple digital temperature sensors on a one-wire bus. It's designed to be low power and can be powered by 2x AA batteries or 5V USB.

The emonTx is one part of the OpenEnergyMonitor end-to-end web-based energy monitoring system. The other parts being a graphical LCD wireless display (emonGLCD), web connected base station receiver (emonBase / Nanode-RF) and emoncms server based energy visualisation web application.
